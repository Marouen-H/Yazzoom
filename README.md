# Yazzoom Anomaly Detection Case

This repo contains:
- An algorithm that does anomaly detection, with 2 extra additional approaches.
- A jupyter notebook that reads this file, detects the anomalies using your algorithm, shows them in a plot and their values.
- write a script in Python that wraps this algorithm in a REST API which receives its arguments as json and returns the output of your algorithm:
Expected input sample:
{ "data" : 
	[
		{
			"x": 7,
			"y": 5
		},
		{
			"x": 0,
			"y": 0
		},
		{
			
			"y": 3,
			"x": 2
		}
	]
}


Expected output sample:
{
    "error": "None",
    "response": [
        1,
        1,
        0
    ],
    "status": 0
}


Files in the repo:
Yazzoom.ipynb : the jupyter notebook containing the algorithm and the plots
distance.py : Python file containing a distance function
main.py : API main file

To run the API:
Download the anomaly.csv file under Yazzoom/ directory
Run the cells 1 to 11, and uncomment the second line in cell 12 to export the pickle file.
From a terminal, execute $ python3 main.py
Get the API link from the instrutions in the terminal (it should look like: http://127.0.0.1:5000)
To query the API:
Send a json object in the expected input format(see Above) through a POST request to API_LINK/DetectAnomalies
